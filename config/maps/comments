All of the digitizing which I have done has a "1" after the file name,
except the optional, compulsory, and other markers where pilots report.
Not all of the optional pilot reportings are in the file; should be soon.

The overlays are set so that my map appears automatically.

The airports, however, have not been updated, but are still set
so they appear when the program is run.  There is a new icon for
the airports, which can be found under Airports1.


There is also a grid, showing lat and lon, which is set to off, but is
a good measure to check accuracy of the locations of everything.
