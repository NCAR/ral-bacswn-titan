Usage: LogFilter -d logdir -p procname [options as below]
options:
       [ -h ] produce this list.
       [ -debug ] print debug messages
       [ -p ] set process name 
       [ -i ] set process instance
       [ -hourly ] set the logs to be placed in hourly files
       [ -single ] create a single log file, not one per day
       [ -t ] interval between time stamp prints (sec)
              defaults to 3600, -1 disables printing
       [ -keepRunningOnError ] keep running if an error occurs
       [ -noLineStamp ] do not time-stamp every line

LogFilter reads ascii log messages from stdin, and copies
  them to a log file in the specified log directory.
  The file name is logdir/yyyymmdd/procname.instance.log, or
  logdir/yyyymmdd/procname.log if the instance is not specfied.
  yyyymmdd is is the current date. The default behavior is for a
  new file to be created each day.
  If the -hourly option is set the hour is appended to the end
  of the filename, and a new file is created every hour.
  Time stamp information is also inserted into the log stream,
  at the interval specified with -t. Set to -1 to disable.
