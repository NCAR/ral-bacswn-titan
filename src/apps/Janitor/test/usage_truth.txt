  The Janitor performs simple housekeeping tasks.
  It recurses through a directory tree. If it finds a 
  file named '_Janitor' anywhere, it reads parameters
  from this file. When the Janitor pops up out of
  the directory these changes are lost and the processing
  reverts to the parameters at the higher level.

  The Janitor is described in more depth in its web page.
